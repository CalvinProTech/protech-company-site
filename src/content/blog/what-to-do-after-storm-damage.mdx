# What to Do After Storm Damage to Your Roof: A Step-by-Step Guide

When a severe storm rolls through your neighborhood, the damage it leaves behind can feel overwhelming. Hail denting your shingles, wind tearing off ridge caps, or a fallen tree branch puncturing your roof deck all require immediate and thoughtful action. The steps you take in the first 48 hours after storm damage play a critical role in protecting your home from further harm and ensuring your insurance claim is processed smoothly.

This guide walks you through exactly what to do, in order, after storm damage strikes your roof.

## Step 1: Ensure Personal Safety First

Before inspecting anything, make sure everyone in your household is safe. If the storm involved lightning, high winds, or possible structural damage, stay indoors until conditions have fully cleared. Downed power lines, unstable trees, and weakened structures are invisible hazards in the immediate aftermath of a storm.

Never climb onto your roof to assess damage yourself. Wet, debris-covered roofs are extremely dangerous even for experienced professionals. Loose shingles, hidden soft spots in the decking, and unstable flashing can cause falls and serious injury. Leave roof-level inspection to trained and insured roofing contractors.

## Step 2: Document the Damage from the Ground

Once it is safe to go outside, walk the perimeter of your home and photograph everything you see. Use your phone to take clear, well-lit photos and videos of:

- Missing, lifted, or damaged shingles visible from the ground
- Dented or dislodged gutters and downspouts
- Fallen tree limbs on or near the roof
- Debris in the yard that may have impacted the roof
- Cracked or broken siding, windows, or fascia
- Any water that has entered the interior of the home

These initial photos serve as critical time-stamped evidence for your insurance claim. Adjusters want to see documentation captured as close to the event as possible.

## Step 3: Prevent Further Damage

Insurance policies include a "duty to mitigate" clause, meaning you are responsible for taking reasonable steps to prevent additional damage after the initial event. If water is entering your home through a roof breach, act quickly to minimize interior damage.

**Immediate mitigation steps include:**
- Place buckets under active leaks to catch water
- Move furniture, electronics, and valuables away from wet areas
- Spread tarps or plastic sheeting over exposed items
- Call a roofing contractor for emergency tarping of the roof

Professional emergency tarping involves securing a heavy-duty tarp over the damaged area to create a temporary waterproof barrier. Reputable contractors like ProTech Roofing offer 24-hour emergency response and can typically have a tarp in place within a few hours of your call. Keep receipts for any emergency services or supplies you purchase, as these costs are generally reimbursable through your insurance claim.

## Step 4: Contact Your Insurance Company

File your claim as soon as possible after the storm. Most insurance companies have streamlined their intake process with phone and app-based filing. When you call, have the following information ready:

- Your policy number
- Date and approximate time of the storm
- A brief description of the visible damage
- Photos and videos you captured in Step 2
- Contact information for your roofing contractor if you have already engaged one

Your insurer will assign a claim number and schedule an adjuster visit, typically within 5 to 15 business days depending on the volume of claims in your area after a widespread storm.

> **Filing Deadline:** Most homeowner insurance policies require claims to be filed within one year of the damage event, though some states have shorter windows. Texas, for example, recently enacted legislation requiring prompt notice, and Florida has a two-year filing deadline for most property claims. Always verify your specific policy terms and file promptly.

## Step 5: Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection

Before the adjuster visits, have a qualified roofing contractor perform their own independent inspection. This is one of the most important steps in the process. A professional roofer can identify damage that is not visible from the ground, including:

- Hail dents on shingles that crack the granule layer without displacing shingles
- Wind-lifted shingles that have resealed but lost their adhesive integrity
- Cracked or displaced flashing around vents, pipes, and chimneys
- Bruised or fractured decking beneath the shingle surface
- Gutter and soffit damage caused by wind-driven debris

A thorough contractor inspection uses drone photography for aerial documentation and thermal imaging to detect moisture that has already penetrated beneath the roofing surface. This documentation creates a comprehensive damage report that aligns with what insurance adjusters need to approve a full claim.

## Step 6: Meet the Insurance Adjuster with Your Contractor

When your insurance adjuster arrives, having your roofing contractor present is one of the most effective ways to ensure a fair claim valuation. Adjusters are trained professionals, but they typically spend 30 to 60 minutes on each property and may not catch every area of damage, particularly on large or complex roofs.

Your contractor can walk the roof with the adjuster, point out documented damage, and provide the detailed repair or replacement estimate that the adjuster uses to calculate the claim value. This collaborative approach reduces the likelihood of an underpayment or a dispute that delays your project.

ProTech Roofing's insurance specialists attend adjuster meetings at no additional cost to the homeowner. Our team has managed thousands of storm damage claims and understands the documentation and terminology that adjusters require.

## Step 7: Review the Insurance Estimate Carefully

After the adjuster's visit, your insurance company will issue a claim estimate that outlines what they are willing to pay for repairs or replacement. Review this document carefully and compare it to your contractor's independent estimate.

Common areas where insurance estimates fall short include:

- **Code upgrades:** If local building codes have changed since your roof was originally installed, the replacement may require additional materials such as ice-and-water shield, enhanced ventilation, or drip edge. These costs should be covered as part of the claim.
- **Hidden damage:** Decking damage, wet insulation, and interior water damage are often not fully visible during the adjuster's initial visit and may require a supplement after tear-off begins.
- **Matching requirements:** Some states require that repairs match the existing roof in color, style, and material. If your shingle line has been discontinued, this may require a larger replacement area than the adjuster initially scoped.

If the insurance estimate is significantly lower than your contractor's assessment, your contractor can file a supplement with additional documentation to request a revised payout. This is a standard part of the insurance claims process and does not require hiring a public adjuster or attorney in most cases.

## Step 8: Proceed with Repairs or Replacement

Once the claim is settled and you have agreed on a scope of work with your contractor, schedule the project. Storm damage restoration follows the same quality standards as any other roof replacement, including proper tear-off, decking inspection and repair, underlayment installation, and new material application.

During the project, your contractor should:
- Document any hidden damage discovered during tear-off with photos
- File supplements with your insurance company for additional covered damage
- Provide daily progress updates and a clean, safe work site
- Deliver all warranty documentation at project completion

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Do not wait too long to act.** Delaying inspection and claim filing allows secondary damage like mold, wood rot, and insulation degradation to develop, complicating the claim and increasing costs.

**Do not sign a contract with a storm chaser.** After major storms, unlicensed contractors go door-to-door soliciting work. Legitimate roofing companies do not ask you to sign a contract on your doorstep. Verify licenses, insurance, reviews, and physical business addresses before engaging any contractor.

**Do not cash the insurance check and forget to make repairs.** If your mortgage company is listed as a payee on the claim check, they will typically require proof that repairs were completed before releasing funds. Even if you have full control of the funds, failing to repair the damage exposes your home to further deterioration and may void future claims.

# Spring Roof Maintenance Checklist: 8 Tasks to Protect Your Home

Winter is the hardest season on your roof. Freezing temperatures, ice, snow loads, high winds, and thermal cycling all stress roofing materials in ways that may not be visible until warmer weather arrives. Spring is the ideal time to assess your roof's condition and address minor issues before they develop into major problems during summer storms.

This checklist covers the eight most important maintenance tasks every homeowner should complete each spring.

## 1. Inspect Shingles from the Ground

Start with a visual scan from ground level using binoculars. Walk around the entire perimeter of your home and look for:

- **Missing shingles** that expose the underlayment or deck
- **Curling or lifted edges** where wind can catch and peel shingles back
- **Dark patches** indicating granule loss or algae growth
- **Debris accumulation** from fallen branches or leaves that may trap moisture

You do not need to climb onto the roof to catch most problems. A ground-level inspection with binoculars identifies the majority of visible shingle issues safely.

If you notice damage in multiple areas, or if your roof is difficult to see from the ground due to height or tree coverage, schedule a professional inspection. Contractors with drone capability can capture high-resolution images of every section without walking on the surface.

## 2. Clean and Inspect Gutters

Gutters that are clogged or damaged cause more secondary roof damage than most homeowners realize. When water cannot flow through the gutter system, it backs up under the shingle edges, saturates the fascia board, and can seep into the soffit and attic.

**Spring gutter maintenance includes:**

- Remove all leaves, twigs, and sediment from gutter troughs
- Flush gutters and downspouts with a hose to confirm water flows freely
- Check for sagging sections where brackets have loosened or fascia has softened
- Inspect gutter seams and end caps for leaks
- Verify downspouts discharge at least four feet from the foundation

> **Prevention Value:** The National Roofing Contractors Association identifies clogged gutters as a leading cause of premature fascia rot and ice dam formation, noting that annual gutter maintenance can extend roof system life by several years.

If your gutters are constantly clogging, consider installing gutter guards. Modern micro-mesh systems handle heavy leaf loads and reduce maintenance to an annual rinse rather than a seasonal cleanout.

## 3. Check Flashing and Sealant

Flashing is the metal sheeting installed wherever the roof surface meets a vertical structure: chimneys, skylights, vent pipes, walls, and valleys. These are the most leak-prone areas on any roof because they rely on both mechanical attachment and sealant to maintain a watertight barrier.

**What to look for:**

- **Lifted or bent flashing** that has pulled away from the surface it seals against
- **Cracked or missing caulk** around flashing edges, especially on the south-facing side where UV exposure is greatest
- **Rust or corrosion** on metal flashing, particularly around chimneys and walls
- **Step flashing gaps** where the roof meets a sidewall

Minor sealant failures can be repaired with a high-quality roofing sealant. However, if the flashing itself is corroded, bent, or improperly installed, a professional repair is necessary to ensure a lasting seal.

## 4. Trim Overhanging Branches

Tree branches that overhang the roof create several risks:

- **Abrasion:** Branches that touch the roof surface scrape granules off shingles with every wind gust, accelerating wear in that area
- **Debris:** Leaves and needles accumulate in valleys and behind dormers, trapping moisture against the roof surface
- **Impact:** Dead or weakened branches can break off during storms and puncture the roof
- **Shade:** Persistent shade promotes moss and algae growth, which retain moisture and degrade shingles

Trim branches back to a minimum of six feet from the roof surface. For large trees or high branches, hire a certified arborist to ensure safe removal without damaging the roof or the tree.

## 5. Look for Moss and Algae

Moss and algae are more than cosmetic problems. Moss holds moisture against the roof surface and can work its way under shingle edges, lifting them and creating entry points for water. Algae, which appears as dark streaks on the roof, feeds on the limestone filler in asphalt shingles and accelerates granule erosion.

**If you find moss:**

- Small patches can be treated with a 50/50 mix of water and white vinegar applied with a garden sprayer
- Never pressure wash a shingle roof, as the force strips granules and voids most manufacturer warranties
- For widespread growth, hire a professional soft-wash service that uses low-pressure application with biodegradable cleaning agents

**To prevent recurrence:**

- Improve sunlight exposure by trimming overhanging branches
- Install zinc or copper strips along the ridge line, which release trace metals during rain that inhibit moss and algae growth
- Choose algae-resistant shingles when it is time for replacement

## 6. Inspect the Attic

An attic inspection reveals problems that are invisible from the outside. On a dry, sunny day, enter the attic with a flashlight and check for:

- **Daylight penetration:** Any visible light through the roof deck means water can follow the same path
- **Water stains:** Dark marks on the underside of the decking or along rafters indicate past or ongoing leaks
- **Mold or mildew:** Musty odors or visible mold growth signal chronic moisture problems that need immediate attention
- **Insulation condition:** Displaced, compressed, or wet insulation reduces energy efficiency and may indicate a roof or ventilation problem
- **Ventilation function:** Confirm that soffit vents are not blocked by insulation and that ridge or gable vents are clear

> **Energy Impact:** The Department of Energy estimates that proper attic ventilation and insulation can reduce heating and cooling costs by 10 to 20 percent. A spring attic check ensures your roof system is performing efficiently before summer cooling loads increase.

## 7. Test Your Ventilation System

Proper attic ventilation prevents heat and moisture buildup that degrades shingles from the underside and promotes mold growth. A balanced ventilation system has roughly equal amounts of intake (soffit vents) and exhaust (ridge vents, powered vents, or gable vents).

**Signs of ventilation problems:**

- Attic feels noticeably hotter than outdoor temperature on a warm day
- Frost or condensation on the underside of the roof deck in late winter
- Paint peeling on exterior soffits or fascia
- Ice dams forming at the eaves during winter (visible as icicles or ice buildup)

If your ventilation seems inadequate, consult a roofing professional. Adding ventilation to an existing roof is straightforward and dramatically extends shingle life, particularly in hot climates like Florida and Texas.

## 8. Document Everything

Take photos of your roof from multiple angles during your spring inspection and save them with the date. This documentation serves three important purposes:

1. **Baseline comparison:** Next spring, you can compare photos to spot gradual changes like increased granule loss or new staining
2. **Insurance claims:** If a storm damages your roof, before-condition photos help demonstrate what damage is new versus pre-existing
3. **Contractor communication:** When you call for an inspection or repair, photos help the contractor understand the situation before arriving

Keep a simple folder on your phone or computer labeled with the year. Five minutes of photography each spring can save hours of dispute resolution if you ever need to file an insurance claim.

## When to Call a Professional

DIY inspections are valuable for catching obvious problems, but they have limits. Schedule a professional inspection if:

- Your roof is more than 15 years old
- You experienced severe storms during winter
- You notice any interior signs of leaking (ceiling stains, peeling paint, musty odors)
- You cannot safely see the entire roof from the ground
- It has been more than two years since your last professional inspection

Professional inspections with thermal imaging can detect trapped moisture beneath shingles that is completely invisible during a visual inspection. Catching these hidden problems early prevents deck rot and structural damage that are far more expensive to repair.

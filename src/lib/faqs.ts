    question: "How long does it take to replace a roof?",
    answer:
      "Most residential roof replacements are completed in 1 to 2 days. The timeline depends on the size of the roof, the materials being installed, and whether structural repairs are needed during tear-off. Larger homes or complex roof designs with multiple valleys, dormers, or steep pitches may require up to 3 days. ProTech Roofing provides a specific timeline estimate after your free inspection so you can plan accordingly.",

  {
    question: "How do I know if my roof needs to be repaired or replaced?",
    answer:
      "A roof typically needs replacement when it is over 20 years old, has widespread shingle deterioration, or shows signs of structural sagging. Repairs are appropriate when damage is isolated to a small area and the rest of the roof is in solid condition. Key warning signs that indicate replacement include granule buildup in gutters, multiple active leaks, daylight visible through the attic, and curling or buckling shingles across large sections.",

  {
    question: "What roofing materials last the longest?",
    answer:
      "Metal roofing lasts 50 to 70 years, making it the longest-lasting mainstream residential option. Concrete and clay tile roofs last 40 to 60 years, while architectural asphalt shingles last 25 to 35 years. Material longevity also depends on proper installation, attic ventilation, and regional climate conditions. ProTech Roofing helps you balance lifespan, aesthetics, and budget to choose the best material for your home.",

    question: "How much does a new roof cost?",
    answer:
      "A new roof typically costs between $8,000 and $25,000 for a residential home, depending on the size, materials, and complexity of the project. Asphalt shingle roofs fall on the lower end while metal and tile roofs cost more upfront but deliver longer lifespans.

    question: "What financing options are available for a new roof?",
    answer:
      "ProTech Roofing partners with multiple lending institutions to offer personal loans, home improvement loans, and same-as-cash promotional plans for roof replacement and repair.

  {
    question: "Can I finance a roof replacement with bad credit?",
    answer:
      "Yes, options exist for homeowners with less-than-perfect credit. ProTech Roofing works with lending partners that consider factors beyond credit score alone, including income stability and home equity. While interest rates may be higher for lower credit profiles, many homeowners qualify for affordable monthly payments. We encourage every homeowner to apply because pre-qualification does not affect your credit score.",

    answer:
      "Yes, ProTech Roofing offers same-as-cash promotional periods of 12 to 18 months for qualified borrowers. During this period, no interest accrues as long as the balance is paid in full before the promotional period ends. This option is ideal for homeowners who want to spread payments over a year without incurring additional costs. Qualification depends on credit profile and loan amount.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use insurance money and financing together for my roof?",
    answer:
      "Yes, many homeowners combine insurance claim proceeds with financing to cover their deductible or to upgrade materials beyond what insurance covers. For example, if your claim covers a standard shingle roof but you want to upgrade to metal, financing can cover the difference. ProTech Roofing's team coordinates with both your insurance company and lending partner to make the process seamless.",
